## 🌟 Highlights

- Adding feature to delete previous material


## ℹ️ Overview

So, my friend at work keep complaining that it takes too long to texture 1 by 1 so he wanted to assign a material using base color only. But, this approach is not good for game development. So, i made this tool to streamline the work
